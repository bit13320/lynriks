This code is a simple HTML document that includes an audio player and displays synchronized lyrics as the audio plays. It consists of three main parts: HTML structure, CSS styles, and JavaScript for functionality.

HTML Structure
<!DOCTYPE html>: Defines the document type and version of HTML.
<html lang="en">: The root element of the document, with an en (English) language attribute.
<head>: Contains metadata, title, external script, and style information.
<meta charset="UTF-8">: Sets the character encoding for the document.
<title>Title</title>: Sets the title of the document.
<script src="lrc.js"></script>: Includes an external JavaScript file named lrc.js.
<body>: Contains the main content of the document.
<div id="box">: A container with an ID of box that will hold the lyrics.
<ul>: An unordered list that will contain the individual lines of lyrics.
<li class="active">1</li>: A list item representing the first line of lyrics, with an active class to highlight it.
<audio src="это_ли_счастье.mp3" controls>: An audio element that loads the specified MP3 file and displays a player with controls.
CSS Styles
CSS resets: The styles remove default margins and padding for all elements and set list-style to none for ul and li elements.
#box: Styles for the lyrics container, including dimensions, border, background color, positioning, and hiding overflow content.
ul: Styles for the unordered list, including absolute positioning, width, and a CSS transition for the top property.
ul > li: Styles for list items, including dimensions, text alignment, and font size.
ul > li.active: Styles for the active list item, setting the text color to sky blue.
audio: Styles for the audio element, including dimensions and centering.
JavaScript
Parsing lyrics:

Two arrays are created: timeArr for timestamps and lrcArr for the corresponding lyrics.
The regular expression reg is used to match and extract timestamp and lyric pairs from the lrcStr string.
The loop iterates over the matches and populates the arrays with the extracted timestamps and lyrics.
Rendering lyrics:

The ul element is selected using querySelector.
A loop iterates over the lrcArr and creates a string of li elements with the lyrics.
The innerHTML of the ul is set to the generated string of li elements.
Synchronizing lyrics with audio playback:

The audio element is selected using querySelector.
An event listener for the timeupdate event is added to the audio element.
Inside the event listener, the current time of the audio playback is formatted into a string timeStr.
The index of the current timestamp in timeArr is found.
If the index is found, the top position of the ul element is updated to scroll the lyrics, and the corresponding list item is given the active class to highlight it.
